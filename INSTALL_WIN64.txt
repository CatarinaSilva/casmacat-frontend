INSTALL_WIN64.TXT
=================


Requirements:
- WampServer 2.2E x64 (wampserver2.2e-php5.4.3-httpd-2.4.2-mysql5.5.24-x64.exe)


Wamp installation:
1) Install WampServer as usual but don't tell the setup program to launch Wamp directly.

2) (Just for 64 bits) Download the fixed cURL version from: "http://www.mediafire.com/?3ay381k3cq59cm2" and/or have a look at
   "http://www.anindya.com/php-5-4-3-and-php-5-3-13-x64-64-bit-for-windows/"
- Open the downloaded zip file and copy the "php_curl.dll" to "C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.4.3\ext", overwriting the
  existing file.


Wamp setup:
1) Open "C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.2\conf\httpd.conf" with an editor
- Enable module mod_deflate (uncomment "LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so")
- Enable module mod_expires (uncomment "LoadModule expires_module modules/mod_expires.so")
- Enable module mod_filter (uncomment "LoadModule filter_module modules/mod_filter.so")
- Enable module mod_headers (uncomment "LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so")
- Enable module mod_rewrite (uncomment "LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so")
- Enable module mod_vhost_alias (uncomment "LoadModule vhost_alias_module modules/mod_vhost_alias.so")
- Change "LogLevel warn" to "LogLevel info" (or debug)


2) Open "C:\wamp\bin\apache\apache2.4.2\bin\php.ini" with an editor
- Change "short_open_tag = Off" to "short_open_tag = On"
- Check that the option "magic_quotes_runtime" is off (should be the default setting)
- Enable cURL (uncomment "extension=php_curl.dll")

3) Start WampServer and check the logs of everything is fine. Also ensure that Wamp is allowed to access the network
   (just click "yes" when Windows prompts you).


Casmacat/Matecat setup:
1) Create the database using phpmyadmin.
- Open "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/"
- Click on "Databases"
- Type your desired database name (lets say "matecat_sandbox") and select "utf8_general_ci" in the drop down box for
  "Collation", then click the "Create" button
- Click on "Users" on the top of the screen
- You'll see different users there. Two of those entries are red and allow everyone without a username and password to
  connect from every host. They must be deleted, otherwise you'll get an error.
- On the left, click now on your new database ("matecat_sandbox")
- Now click on "Privileges" on the top of the screen
- Click "Add user" in the middle
- Type in the username and password
- Select the option "Grant all privileges on database "matecat_sandbox"" in the "Database for user" box
- Click "Add user" at the bottom
- Click on "Import" on the top of the screen
- Select the matecat.sql file and click ok. Do the same with the casmacat.sql file. (you have to zip sql files if you want to import them from phpmyadmin)


That's all folks! Hopefully :-)
