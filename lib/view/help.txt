You are about to test a new computer-aided translation tool. The tool 
implements Interactive Translation Prediction (ITP), a post-edition paradigm 
where each time the user makes a correction the computer software suggests a 
new translation that includes all previous user corrections. This process 
continues until the suggested translation matches the user’s expectations.

Features
--------

- A new translation is automatically suggested after each keypress
- The system will highlight the part of the predicted translation it considers to 
be correct, you can use the TAB key to quickly jump this part

Post-editing guidelines with ITP
--------------------------------

- You are assumed to post-edit the suggested translations from left to right, 
i.e. translation errors at the beginning of the translation are to be corrected 
first
- However, you can go back and post-edit a previous error if necessary. In this 
case translation prediction is deactivated
- Don’t waste time deleting wrong translations. It is more productive to 
start editing the wrong text while the system makes news translation proposals 
to the right of you typing.
- ITP can be disabled using the ESC key whenever the system becomes too 
annoying for you.

Useful shortcuts
----------------

- **ESC** toggles translation prediction
- **TAB** moves the cursor to the beginning of the next translation prediction
- **CTRL+SHIFT+S** toggles limitation of prediction length 
- **CTRL+M** toggles highlighting of source words aligned to target word under the caret 
- **CTRL+SHIFT+1** toggles highlighting of aligned words of the word under the mouse cursor 
- **CTRL+SHIFT+4** toggles highlighting of user validated words
